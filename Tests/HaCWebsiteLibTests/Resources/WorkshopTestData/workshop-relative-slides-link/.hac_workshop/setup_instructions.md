If you have a Windows laptop, please install the application 'PuTTY' before you arrive by downloading ['putty.exe'](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

This workshop requires connection to a UNIX machine (Linux, macOS) so to play along you'll be connecting to a UNIX machine using PuTTY.
